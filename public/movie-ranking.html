 <h1>The Best Movies According To Deepak</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
 <hr/>
<h3>3 Idiots</h3> 
<p>Three friends. One genius. A system questioned.
Rancho, the free spirit, teaches us to chase excellence — not marks.
In a world ruled by pressure and rote,
It screams "All is well" — if your heart truly floats.</p>
<h3>Chichoree</h3>
<p>A nostalgic dive into college days, where friendship, failure, and fun collide.
A father’s heartbreak meets a story of losers who never gave up.
Laughter, love, and lessons — that success isn’t everything,
But the fight, the fall, and the rise... that’s what makes life worth living.</p>
<h3>Bahubali</h3>
<p>A tale of kingdoms, betrayal, and might,
Of Mahendra and Amarendra — father and son shining bright.
With waterfalls, wars, and whispers of fate,
“Why did Kattappa kill Baahubali?” — kept us awake.
