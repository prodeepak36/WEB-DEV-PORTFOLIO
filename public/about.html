<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Deepak — a curious coder, relentless learner, and a dreamer grounded in action.
Pursuing B.Tech in Information Technology at GGSIPU, I’ve walked through failures, faced them head-on, and turned them into fuel. Every setback lit a fire. Every challenge sharpened my focus.</p>

<p>I’m not just building skills; I’m building myself — from logic in C/C++ to elegant web apps, from chess strategies to life strategies.
Learning by day, reflecting by night.
Falling, rising, improving.</p>

<p>My passion lies in blending technology with creativity — crafting digital solutions that solve problems and inspire progress. Whether it's web development, algorithms, or understanding the electric pulse of the real world, I strive to go beyond the syllabus and into the soul of things.</p>
